# 📝 Responsive Animated Form

A responsive, fully functional form built as part of a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge. This form features smooth notification animation, client-side validation, and mobile-friendly design—all implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ **Fully Responsive** – Looks great on all screen sizes
* 🧠 **JavaScript Validation** – Real-time input validation with helpful error messages
* 🎯 **Functional Form** – All fields are interactive and behave as expected

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid, Animations)
* Vanilla JavaScript (for validation and interactivity)

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RohitSagar911/Contact-form-by-FeM.git
   cd Contact-form-by-FeM
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser:

   ```bash
   start index.html
